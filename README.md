# openweather-API

Here you can see the weather description, temperature as well as an icon depicting the weather description on entering the city name. 
It works only in the localhost. 

I have used API of openweather for this. 
Learnt about Postman, an API platform and parsing JSON using JSON viewer pro amongst others. 

Thanks :)
